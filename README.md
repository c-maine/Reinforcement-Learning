# Reinforcement-Learning
Experiments and implementations of Reinforcement Learning algorithms:


Bayesian_optimisation_vF.ipynb implements Bayesian optimisation for UCB, EI and PI acquisition functions on a Branin-Hoo landscape using Gaussian Processes

Gaussian_Processes_vF.ipynb is a replication of the results from Figures 2.4 and 2.5 in Rasmussen & Williams Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning

TD_LSTD_vF.ipynb is an implementation of the Temporal Difference and Least Squares Temporal Difference Learning algorithms. 

Value_iteration_vF.ipynb is an implementation of the Value Iteration for the Gambler's Problem (Exercise Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction, 2nd edition" by Sutton & Barto (2018)

chapelle_li_vF.ipynb is an empirical evaluation of Thompson Sampling and replication of the 2010 paper by Chapelle and Li: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4321-an-empirical-evaluation-of-thompson-sampling.pdf
